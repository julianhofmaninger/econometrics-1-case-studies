## 🎯 Research Objective
The goal of this Case Study is to estimate the **returns of education**. More precisely speaking that means, we want to examine what the effect of education is on earnings on the labor market. The more specific question asked in this Case Study was to find out which properties differentiate "good" from "bad" schools in a sense that graduates from one school earn more than others. Furthermore, we are only interested in "non-charter" schools.
